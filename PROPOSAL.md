# Project Proposal

## Project Choice

- A LOTR version of the board game risk with simplified rules.

## Project Description 

This is the Lord of the Rings version of Risk in a browser game.  Risk is basically a game based on world conquest territory by territory.  Two players face-off to determine who ultimately can conquer the world and occupy every territory.  

Game Play Outline:
1. Placement: Each player starts out with a given number of individual troop units and places them in territories to initally claim them.  
2. Player turns: 
    a.Troop Increase - On the players turn they are first awarded troops based on the number of territories they have occupied in addition to having complete control over a region (a clearly-designated group of territories).
    b. Movement - they are allowed to make one move of a number of troops from one territory to another in their control
    c. Attack(optional) - Players are now allowed to make as many attacks as desired.  Dice rolls from both sides determine the outcome.
3. The player that conquers all territories is the winner.

I'm aware that in the original game there are cards awarded as bonuses for conquering at least one territory in that turn.  I may incorporate this as later as a stretch goal.
